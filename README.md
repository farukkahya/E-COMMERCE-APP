# React E-Commerce App

_(The project is not finished.)_

    To be honest, I faced a lot of problems while preparing this project. The biggest of these problems is that I could not activate the backend I wanted to use in the project (Backend does not belong to me.). As a matter of fact, I do a lot of research to solve the problems I encounter in transactions such as user registration and login. But I can't find a solution for some issues, so I improvise. This is why the codes you see in this repository are spaghetti codes. I will try to develop this project without a backend as much as I can and make it easier to understand with comment lines.
